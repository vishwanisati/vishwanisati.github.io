          I am a graduate student at Northwestern University, majoring in Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from Amity University, India. My research interests are in Information Retrieval, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and all things Machine Learning. During this summer, I interned at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. I worked in the AWS organization at East Palo Alto, where I worked on developing auroracr (a wrapper tool which executes Dry Run Build commands to build mentioned packages into custom and corresponding version sets (while supporting the existing CodeReview tool functionalities) and vended it to the BuilderToolBox. Post graduating from Northwestern, I will returning to Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. <br />

          Previously, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher at Prof. Juan Corchado's lab at University of Salamanca, Spain. I spent six months working on designing and developing intelligent PPE which aimed at making coal mine worker's environment safe. Our results were accepted by Springer for publication. I also interned at the Wisma R&D lab, University of Malaya, Malaysia for two consecutive summers. I collaborated with Reasearch Interns from Morrocco and Pakistan to work on establishing communication between vehicles in time sensitive applications. Our work got published in Elsevier's journal of Vehicular Communications.<br />
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          At my time here in Northwestern, I have complete graduate level courses in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science Pipeline. I also upskilled myself by completing courses on Full Stack development, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and Marketing Analysis.
