          This project focuses on implementing face detection, face recognition and face emotion recognition through NVIDIA’s state-of-the-art Jetson Nano. Face detection is implemented using OpenCV’s deep learning-based DNN face detector, supported by a ResNet architecture, for achieving better accuracy than the previously developed models. The result computed by framework libraries of OpenCV, with the support of the above-mentioned hardware, displayed reliable accuracy even with the change in lighting and angle. For face recognition, the approach of deep metric learning using OpenCV, supported by a ResNet-34 architecture, is used. Face emotion recognition is achieved by developing a system in which the areas of eyes and mouth are used to convey the analysis of the information into a merged new image, classifying the image into displaying any of the seven basic facial emotions. A powerful and a low-power platform, Jetson Nano carried out intensive computations of algorithms easily contributing in high video processing frame.<br />

          Face detection and recognition, useful for constructing numerous industrial and commercial applications, is a challenge for many researchers. For making the methodologies more efficient and improving the results, improvement of small features can be done. As technology is advancing, more advanced features can be added to the system, which might be helpful in increasing the accuracy. Also, face emotion recognition is conducted using ANN. Using the same architecture, real time face emotion recognition can be developed, while also increasing the reliability and possibilities.<br />
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          The OpenCV’s Deep Learning Face Detector shows better performance in terms of accuracy than the Haar Cascades. The developed model detects faces with the accuracy of 99.96% for the face closer to the webcam and 99.31% for the detected face a bit farther away. Also, with a powerful board like Nano, intensive computation of DNN Face Detector can be carried out easily. The model also is robust as it gives an accuracy of 89.99% even in condition where the lighting is dim. The face is detected with an accuracy of 72.87% where the face is not at a straight angle. This wouldn’t have worked well with the Haar Cascades. Not quite faster, but a robust face detection software is built, with a better accuracy than the Haar Cascades, using OpenCV’s deep learning-based face detector.<br />
