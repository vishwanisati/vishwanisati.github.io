          Wearable technologies have begun to play an important role in the workplace. This project presents a Smart PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) solution which employs a sensor network located on a helmet and a belt to monitor the state of the worker and the environment. Most of the accidents that occur in the workplace are caused by the lack of prevention measures, poor safety training and obsolete safety systems which do no adapt technologically to the needs of today’s work environments. The solutions provided by Industry 4.0 for hazard prevention and propose a wireless PPE model that incorporates intelligent tools and fabrics capable of reacting in real time to a risk situation. This novel model implements continuous risk monitoring biometrics of the worker, detects the external impact, shock, luminosity, gases, temperature of the environment and provides real-time recommendations to workers. The motivation behind this work is to improve health and safety in work sectors with high accident risk.<br />
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          Within this framework, several intelligent PPE have been developed, they incorporate wearable electronics and provide advanced functionalities which adapt to conventional products. A series of JSA (Job Safety Analysis) procedures have been performed to identify and group activities/sectors that involve highest accident risk. Subsequently, we considered the use of different sensors, actuators and protection elements, to appropriately address the identified dangers. The analyzed devices included temperature, impact, piezoelectric, gas, microphone, humidity, pressure, and accelerometer sensors etc. As well as vibration, led and loudspeaker actuators. For communications we have studied bluetooth technology, Wi-Fi, radio frequency, ZigBee, etc. Where applicable, conductive elements, such as conductive fabric, conductive wire, conductive cord, electroluminescent cable, etc., have also been integrated in the garments.<br />
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          In order to improve the detection of anomalies obtained from the components of the electronic systems, 6 artificial intelligence algorithms are used, which were trained taking an average of 50,000 data collected from each of the electronic systems, which were submitted to Data Cleansing techniques in order to reduce the presence of errors during training. In the training data and test phase of the artificial intelligence models, the reliability intervals of the supervised learning algorithms are obtained respectively, highlighting the use of Random Forest (classifier) during the research, with a margin of error of 0.0106 %.<br />
